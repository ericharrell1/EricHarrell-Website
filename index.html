        <br>Hello, my name is Eric Harrell. Ever since I was little, I loved making stories. There were no limits, in terms of medium. Sometimes, I would make a story with action figures. Other times, I would make books for my best friend. At the time, I thought it was just because I was a kid that had a wild imagination. However, as I grew older, that passion for making stories never went away. Eventually, I decided that the best way to use my talent was to join the film industry. At first, I chose to pursue art, fearing that writing would be too risky. A couple of art classes later, I decided that it wasnâ€™t for me. In the end, I stuck with writing because thatâ€™s where my passion truly lied. Currently, I am attending UC Riverside to get my bachelor's in creative writing and then get my master's in screenplay writing. 

Other activities that partake in are playing Dungeons and Dragons and working at Harkins Theater. When I play Dungeons and Dragons, Iâ€™m usually the dungeon master, which means that I make the campaigns. Still, from time to time, I will be a player. During high school, I joined the Dungeons and Dragons club. This was my first time playing a game that followed most of the official rules. Whether it be home-brewed or by the book, Dungeons and Dragons are one of my favorite hobbies to indulge in. 

I currently work at Harkins Theater right now. I just started a little while ago, so I do not have that much work experience. Right now, I am part of the cleanup crew. Iâ€™ll either be sweeping popcorn, cleaning a theater after a showing, or cleaning the bathrooms. I actually really enjoy my job. The pay is pretty good, I get to see free movies, I like the people who work there, and they are flexible with their hours. For anyone looking for their first job, I would definitely recommend working at Harlins. 

I created this website to really get my work out there and show what I can do. My goal is to challenge myself with whatever prompts people bring to me. They may not be my preferred genre, but I think as a writer, it is good to do things that are outside your comfort zone. I hope one day that I will be able to write a screenplay for a company like Disney or Universal, but, in the meantime, I can improve my writing skills by taking commissions on this site. If you are interested in getting a screenplay commissioned by me, contact me at eharr036@ucr.edu. There we can discuss more details about the screenplay itself. Please keep in mind that it usually takes one to two months to complete. Also, if I am filled up with commissions, there is a chance that you could be put on a waiting list. If you have gotten this far, thank you for reading my bio. Hopefully, you will consider commissioning me.
